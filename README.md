The "Hangman-with-MYSQL" application collects user data regarding game outcomes (win or loss) and performs the following steps:

User data, including game results, is stored in a text file.
The text file is converted to a CSV file, enabling easier data manipulation and organization.
The CSV file is utilized to transfer the user data into a MySQL database.
The MySQL database stores the user records, allowing for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
This application seamlessly integrates the Hangman game, data storage in text and CSV formats, and the MySQL database for enhanced data management and analysis.


The program flow consists of the following steps:

Hangman.py game is created to interact with the user and determine game outcomes.
User's game results (whether they won or lost) are stored in a text file.
The text file is converted to a CSV file using the pandas library, organizing the user record data from Hangman.py.
The CSV file is utilized to write the data to a MySQL database, creating a table to store the user records.
The MySQL table is accessed within the Python program to read and retrieve user data as needed.
Note: Each step involves specific coding and implementation, which can be achieved using relevant Python libraries and appropriate database connection methods.
